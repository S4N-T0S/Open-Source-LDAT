# This script uses the "Direct Inject" method to guarantee the patch is applied.
# It works by:
# 1. Finding the original usb_desc.h in the framework-arduinoteensy package.
# 2. Creating a backup of the original file (usb_desc.h.bak).
# 3. Overwriting the original usb_desc.h with our patched 8kHz version.
# 4. After the compilation is complete, it automatically restores the backup.
# This is a safe and robust way to bypass PlatformIO build system quirks.
