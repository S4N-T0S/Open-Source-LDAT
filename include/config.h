// --- Mouse Presence Check Configuration (8-bit ADC: 0-255) ---
// The check now verifies two conditions:
// 1. The voltage is high enough (at least MOUSE_PRESENCE_MIN_ADC_VALUE).
// 2. The voltage is stable (fluctuation is less than MOUSE_STABILITY_THRESHOLD_ADC).

// This sets the minimum acceptable ADC value. 3.0V on a 3.3V system with an 8-bit ADC.
// Calculation: (3.0 / 3.3) * 255 = ~231.

// Calculation: (0.2 / 3.3) * 255 = ~15.

// This sets how long the script will hold the mouse click signal when sending via USB,
// the higher this number, the higher latency you will see added from this value.
// The Teensy 4.1 has been modified to run at 8000 Hz polling rate for USB HID devices. So this value should be set to 250 for Direct modes, or to minmax 150.
// >>>>>>>>>>> PLEASE SET IT TO A VALUE CLOSEST TO YOUR MOUSE POLLING RATE! <<<<<<<<<<

// SAFE AND ROBUST VALUES (I would lower from these guidelines only if you are limit testing):
// For example if I have a very reliable mouse/system, I might set my value to just over the polling rate, e.g., 135 for 8kHz polling rate.
// At 8k Hz polling rate, each poll is 125 microseconds, so holding for 2 of these polls is very safe (250 microseconds)
// At 4k Hz polling rate, each poll is 250 microseconds... (500 microseconds)
// At 2k Hz polling rate, each poll is 500 microseconds... (1000 microseconds)
// At 1k Hz polling rate, each poll is 1000 microseconds... (2000 microseconds)
// At 500 Hz polling rate, each poll is 2000 microseconds... (4000 microseconds)
// At 250 Hz polling rate, each poll is 4000 microseconds... (8000 microseconds)
